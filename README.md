Explain your idea in one sentence
Making education in universities entertaining and engaging by using an economic simulation game where students can learn, interact, build their businesses, careers and take part in virtual internships offered by real companies in a risk free environment.



Explain your idea in one paragraph
Feynman is a software consisting of three main modules. The first module is the Single Player Module and its purpose is to be used in exercises. The students will be introduced in a simulation game where they will walk through all their assignments in a role playing way. The second module is the Multiplayer Module where students will have the opportunity to build businesses in a simulated environment that mimics the real world. The third module is the Recruiting module where real world companies will offer virtual internships.




Explain why your idea is innovative. If your idea is based on an existing concept, explain how your use of that concept is innovative in the country or context where it will be implemented.
Judging Criteria: “Innovation: either disruptive or incremental (building on what has been done before). Critically, the idea must be innovative at least within its given socio-economic and geographical context.”

Feynman aims to make the educational process in universities a better and more engaging experience in three steps. 
Single Player Module. 
In the single player module, the students will be given assignments where their answers will affect their future progress. Using this technique, the student will be more engaged with the process. The single player module will identify missing knowledge using follow up questions when there is a wrong decision, thus it will offer every student an individual educational program which will tell the student where they should focus and fill their missing knowledge.
Multiplayer Module. 
Once the student has passed the Single player module they will be allowed to enter a simulated environment where they will interact with other students, build business and practice soft skills such as creativity, critical thinking, negotiating and managing people. The simulation will be based on the city where the university is in order to be as realistic as possible and prepare the students for their future career.  
Recruiting Module. 
Real world companies will be included in the simulation and they will offer virtual internships. This way they will save the usual 1 to 3 months of transition time which fresh graduates need to adapt to the work environment. Offering virtual internships will save the company money and costly mistakes by the intern will be eliminated. 
The recruiting module is a stretch goal and will be added after the initial development and testing.

Explain how your idea will empower young people to participate fully in a changing economy and how you would use a place-based approach.
Judging Criteria: “Impact: the potential of the proposed idea to tackle the issue outlined in the challenge statement. The entrant should demonstrate a clear definition of the problem their idea aims to solve, an understanding of how that fits with the challenge statement and who would benefit from it, feeding into a well-elaborated theory of change”
The world around us changes in a fast pace. Educational systems however haven’t changed much even though they are the foundation of a good economy. Going through university has turned into a stressful experience, the amount of information we have to learn is becoming larger every day because of the fast progressing world we live in and teachers don’t have time to pay attention to every student. This leaves students in an uncomfortable position where they are punished for making mistakes and because of the large amount of information and short timespan they won’t be given a chance to learn from their mistakes and try again. Most universities present information in a way where students have all the parts for the puzzle but are unable to solve it because they are not given the big picture. Knowledge is presented in isolated pieces instead of logically connected parts of a unified entity. Feynman will give students the freedom of making mistakes and learning from them by using algorithms to analyze why something went wrong and telling the student where they should focus before trying again. The software will also present the information as a semantic tree where transitions from one subject to another will be unnoticeable because of the logical connections between them. Additional soft skills such as creativity, critical thinking, negotiating and managing people are learned through the multiplayer module. 


Explain how you will design and test the idea with potential users to develop it into a sustainable project over the next three years. *

Judging Criteria: “Sustainability: the financial and environmental sustainability of the idea, as well as the potential for adequacy and uptake stemming from the development of the idea carried out with users, from first concept, through testing, validation and business modelling.“

The idea was presented to one of the biggest economics universities in Bulgaria and there are ongoing talks about a cooperation in the development of the project. Teachers from one of the university’s departments will take part in the digitalization of knowledge and turning it into a simulation game where information is easy to digest. Students will be able to test the project during the development and give us feedback. Game developers have been contacted and are willing to be involved in this innovative project. Once Feynman is developed to work on the department level in the university, we will move on to the faculty level where more courses will be included in the simulation and interactions will be created between them. Once we create a stable working version for one university, businesses will be invited to try the recruiting module. The Recruiting Module will give information about the students’ progress and achievements in the Multiplayer Module, should they agree to share it. Recruiters will design internships in the simulation together with our team and offer them to students who want to apply. The businesses will receive detailed information about the progress of a student who is in their internship program and will be able to give them accurate feedback. Using Feynman, the transition from a graduate to an employee will be a smoother and less stressful process. 


Explain how you will grow your idea in the future so it can reach more people or be replicated by other people across Europe.*

Judging Criteria: “Scale: the idea’s growth potential and potential to scale and be replicated throughout Europe.”



Using the more complex connections in the Multiplayer Module, users from other countries will be able to join the virtual world. Multiple options will be developed to support interaction between different courses and specializations, such as architect - building contractor - construction company - raw material supplier - business owner commissioning an office building. With every additional connection between different universities and courses the simulation will become more realistic and will depict an adequate picture of the real world that awaits the students after they graduate. Feynman can help students develop their CV by creating a profile based on the decisions taken in the Multiplayer Module, which will be a useful tool for recruiters.
